# Batch Variation Tracker

This document is a LIVE REFERENCE that should be updated as you draft messages within a batch. Its purpose is to prevent the #1 failure mode: multiple messages in the same batch sounding identical.

## HOW TO USE THIS

Before drafting each message in a batch:
1. Check what structures, openers, CTAs, and phrases have already been used
2. Select DIFFERENT options for the new draft
3. After drafting, log what you used

If you're drafting a batch of 10+ messages, you MUST use at least:
- 3 different structural approaches
- 4 different opening moves
- 4 different CTA phrasings
- 3 different subject line patterns (for emails)
- 2 different greeting styles

## VARIATION RULES

### Same-Group Contacts
If multiple contacts share the same Group (e.g., 5 Exeter alums in one batch):
- NEVER use the same "I'm a [Group] alum" phrasing for all of them
- Vary how the shared connection is referenced:
  - "Fellow PEA alum here."
  - "As an Exeter alum,”"
  - "Through the Exeter network..."
  - Reference Exeter indirectly through a shared person or experience
  - Don't mention it explicitly at all (just use a warm tone that implies familiarity)

### Same-Industry Contacts
If multiple contacts are in the same industry:
- Vary what you find interesting about the industry for each person
- Reference different aspects of their specific company/role
- Don't use the same industry insight as the hook more than once

### Same-Category Contacts
If 5+ messages are in the same category (e.g., all warm re-engagements):
- Use at least 3 of the structural variations from the Category Playbook
- Ensure no two consecutive messages share the same structure
- Vary paragraph count: some 2-paragraph, some 3-paragraph, some single-block
