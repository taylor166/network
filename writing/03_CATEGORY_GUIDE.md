# Category Playbooks

Each outreach type has different goals, constraints, and success criteria. Select the right playbook based on the contact data, then draft accordingly.

---

## CATEGORY 1: WARM RE-ENGAGEMENT

**When to use:** Type = "existing" OR last_contact_date exists. You know this person. They know you.

**Goal:** Restart a dormant relationship with a natural reason to reconnect. Get a call on the books.

**Strategy:**
- Lead with a personal update (Stanford, Mavnox, career move) - this gives them a reason you're writing NOW vs. any other time
- Show genuine interest in what THEY'RE doing. Don't make it all about you.
- The ask should feel like catching up, not networking.

**Structure (flexible, not rigid):**
1. Personal update or shared context reference (1 sentence)
2. Genuine interest in them (1 sentence)
3. Low-friction ask (1 sentence)

**Calibration notes:**
- If last contact was < 6 months ago: skip the "it's been a while" framing. Just write like you're continuing a conversation.
- If last contact was 6-18 months: light acknowledgment of time gap is fine.
- If last contact was 18+ months: you might need a stronger hook. Reference something specific about them or what's changed for you.

**Email variations (use DIFFERENT structures, not the same one with swapped variables):**

Variation A - Update-first:
```
[Name] -

Quick update from my end: I'm heading to Stanford in the fall and building out an AI consulting practice before I go.

Been thinking about you - how's [company] going? Would love to catch up if you've got 20 minutes sometime.

Best,
Taylor
```

Variation B - Them-first:
```
Hi [Name] -

Saw [something specific about them: promotion, company news, post they wrote]. That's great.

On my end, I'm making a move to Stanford this fall. Would be great to catch up before things get crazy. Free for a call next week?

Taylor
```

Variation C - Direct:
```
[Name] -

I'm leaving Berkshire and heading to Stanford in the fall. Before I go, trying to talk to the people I actually want to stay in touch with. You're on that list.

You free for a call?

Best,
Taylor
```

Variation D - Context-specific:
```
Hey [Name] -

I keep seeing [industry/topic] headlines and thinking of our conversation about [thing you discussed]. Curious how your thinking has evolved.

I'm in a transition myself: Stanford in the fall, building an AI practice in the meantime. I'd love to connect if you're available for a call.

Talk soon,
Taylor
```

**Text variations:**

Variation A:
```
[Name]! Making some moves - heading to Stanford in the fall. Would love to catch up before things get crazy. Free for a call this week?
```

Variation B:
```
Hey [Name], been a minute. How's [company/city]? I'm transitioning out of Berkshire, starting Stanford in September. Let me know if you've got time for a quick call.
```

Variation C:
```
[Name] - saw [specific thing about them]. Hope you're doing well. I've got some news on my end too. Free to talk this week?
```

## CATEGORY 2: COLD INTRO (SHARED NETWORK)

**When to use:** Type = "2026_new" AND Group is valid (PEA, McK, GU, BP, MBA, MVNX, fam).

**Goal:** Earn a first conversation with someone you share a meaningful affiliation with but haven't met.

**Strategy:**
- The shared network is your ticket in, but it's not the whole message. Don't lean on it too hard.
- Establish what YOU'RE doing and why THEY'RE specifically interesting (not generically interesting).
- The ask should feel like genuine curiosity, not a networking checkbox.

**Key principle: specificity > template.** "I'm interested in your perspective on AI" is weak. "I've been thinking about how AI changes the unit economics of field services businesses and your work at [company] is one of the more interesting examples" is strong.

**Structure (flexible):**
1. Connection point - how you're linked (1 phrase, woven in naturally)
2. What caught your attention about them specifically (1-2 sentences)
3. What you're doing and why it's relevant to them (1 sentence)
4. Ask (1 sentence)

**Email variations:**

Variation A - Shared network, their work as hook:
```
Hi [Name] -

Fellow [Exeter/McKinsey/Georgetown] alum here. I've been following what you're building at [company] â€” [specific observation about their business or approach].

I'm heading to Stanford this fall and in the meantime building an AI automation practice for services businesses. Your experience in [specific area] is relevant to what I'm thinking about.

Any chance you'd have some free time for a quick call?

Best,
Taylor
```

Variation B - Lead with the question:
```
[Name] -

I've been thinking about [specific question related to their industry/work] and your name keeps coming up in [Group] circles.

Quick background: I'm a [Group] alum, currently at Berkshire, heading to Stanford in the fall. Building an AI consulting practice on the side.

Please let me know if you're free to hop on the phone for a quick call. I'd genuinely like to hear your take.

Taylor
```

Variation C - Casual, peer-to-peer:
```
Hi [Name] -

We haven't met but we're both [Group] - I'm at Berkshire, heading to Stanford in September. Your move from [previous role] to [current role] caught my eye.

I'm building something in AI automation for services businesses and would value your perspective. Could we find time for a call?

Best,
Taylor
```

**Text variations:**

Variation A:
```
Hi [Name], this is Taylor Walshe, fellow [Group] alum. I'm at Berkshire heading to Stanford this fall, and I've been interested in what you're doing at [company]. Would you be open to a quick call sometime?
```

Variation B:
```
Hey [Name], Taylor Walshe here. We share [Group] - I saw your work in [industry] and it connects to something I'm building. Any chance you'd have 15 minutes for a call?
```

---

## CATEGORY 3: COLD INTRO (NO SHARED NETWORK)

**When to use:** Type = "2026_new" AND Group is "Other" or blank.

**Goal:** Earn a first conversation with a true stranger. Hardest category.

**Strategy:**
- You have ~10 words to earn their attention. Lead with the most compelling thing.
- The hook must be SPECIFIC to them. Generic = delete.
- Your credibility signals (Berkshire, McKinsey, Stanford) do heavy lifting here - use them, but don't make the email about your resume.
- Keep it shorter than any other category. Respect that they don't know you.

**Structure:**
1. Why you're writing them specifically (1 sentence - this is the make-or-break line)
2. Who you are in ~10 words (1 phrase)
3. Ask (1 sentence)

**Email variations:**

Variation A - Their work as the hook:
```
Hi [Name] -

[Specific observation about their company, a decision they made, something they wrote, or a trend in their space]. That caught my attention.

I'm Taylor. I work in PE at Berkshire Partners and I'm building an AI automation practice for services businesses. I think there's overlap with what you're doing.

Would you have time for a quick call in the next few days? Let me know.

Best,
Taylor
```

Variation B - Industry angle:
```
[Name] -

I've been researching [industry] and your approach at [company] stands out from what I've seen.

I'm at Berkshire Partners, heading to Stanford this fall, and building something in AI automation. Would like to hear how you think about [specific operational question].

Happy to work around your schedule for a brief call.

Taylor
```

**Text variations:**

Variation A:
```
Hi [Name], this is Taylor Walshe. I work in PE at Berkshire Partners and have been following your work in [industry]. Would you be open to a brief call? I'd like to hear your perspective on [specific topic].
```

## CATEGORY 4: POST-CALL FOLLOW-UP

**When to use:** After a call, meeting, or conversation has happened.

**Goal:** Cement the relationship. Show you were paying attention. Create a reason for next contact.

**Strategy:**
- Reference something SPECIFIC from the conversation. Not "great chat" â€” what specifically was great about it?
- If they offered to help with something (intro, resource, advice), acknowledge it and make it easy.
- If you offered to send something, send it in this email.
- Plant a seed for the next interaction.

**Email variations:**

Variation A - Reference + next step:
```
[Name] -

Really enjoyed the conversation, especially your point about [specific thing they said]. That reframed how I'm thinking about [topic].

[If applicable: I'll follow up on [thing you discussed]. / Attaching [thing you promised].]

Let's stay in touch - I'll ping you [timeframe/trigger for next contact].

Best,
Taylor
```

Variation B - Short and warm:
```
[Name] -

Thanks for the time today. Your take on [specific thing] was exactly what I needed to hear.

I'll keep you posted on how [your thing] develops. And if [offer you can make to them] would be helpful on your end, just say the word.

Taylor
```

**Text variations:**

Variation A:
```
[Name] - thanks for the call. Your point about [specific thing] stuck with me. Let's stay in touch, I'll keep you in the loop on [topic].
```

## CATEGORY 5: WARM INTRO REQUEST

**When to use:** You want someone to introduce you to someone else.

**Goal:** Make it as easy as possible for the connector. Give them the exact language to forward.

**Strategy:**
- Be explicit about who you want to meet and why.
- Write the forwardable blurb FOR them. Don't make them do work.
- Acknowledge the social capital they're spending.

**Email structure:**
1. What you're asking for (1 sentence)
2. Why this specific person (1 sentence)
3. Forwardable blurb (clearly delineated)
4. Graceful out â€” make it easy to say no

**Example:**
```
[Connector Name] -

Would you be open to connecting me with [Target Name]? I've been thinking about [topic] and [his/her] work at [company] is directly relevant to what I'm building.

If you're comfortable, here's a quick blurb you could forward:

---
"Hey [Target], wanted to introduce you to Taylor Walshe. He's at Berkshire Partners, heading to Stanford in the fall, and building an AI automation practice for services businesses. He's been thinking about [specific topic] and thought you'd have a useful perspective. Figured I'd connect you two. Taylor, over to you."
---

Totally understand if the timing isn't right. Appreciate you either way.

Best,
Taylor
```

---

## CATEGORY 6: CLIENT/PROSPECT NURTURE

**When to use:** Someone who is or could be a consulting client for Mavnox.

**Goal:** Stay top of mind. Provide value. Create natural openings for business conversations.

**Strategy:**
- Lead with value, not asks. Send them something useful.
- Reference their specific business context, not generic AI trends.
- Position yourself as someone who understands their world, not someone selling a service.

**Email variations:**

Variation A - Share something relevant:
```
[Name] -

Came across [article/tool/case study] and thought of your [specific business challenge]. [1 sentence on why it's relevant to them.]

Happy to walk through how this could apply to [their company] if you're interested.

Best,
Taylor
```

Variation B - Check in with substance:
```
[Name] -

Been thinking about our conversation re: [specific topic]. I've since worked on something similar with [anonymized reference if applicable] and there's a pattern emerging around [insight].

I'd love to schedule a call with you to see if this maps to where you are now. Are there any days or times in these next few days that work for you?

Taylor
