# Taylor's Voice Guide

This document defines how Taylor writes. Not how he *should* write, how he *does* write. Every draft must sound like it came from this person.

## VOICE DNA

### Sentence Structure
- Taylor writes short. Average sentence: 8-14 words.
- He rarely uses compound sentences with semicolons.
- He'll occasionally drop a sentence fragment for emphasis. Like this.
- He favors active voice almost exclusively.
- He front-loads the point. Context comes after, not before.

### Word Choice
- Plain language. "Talk" not "connect." "Hear" not "gain insights from."
- No corporate speak: never "leverage," "synergies," "touch base," "circle back," "bandwidth."
- No hedge words in asks: not "I was wondering if maybe you might..." Just "You free next week?"
- Contractions always: "I'm" not "I am," "I'd" not "I would," "you're" not "you are."
- Slightly casual register even in professional contexts. He'd say "pretty wild" not "remarkable."

### Greeting Patterns
Taylor rotates greetings naturally. He does NOT always use the same one.

**Email greetings (rotate across these):**
- "Hi [Name] -" (his default, uses an en-dash not emdash)
- "[Name] -"
- "Hey [Name] -" (only for people he knows well)
- "[Name]," (rare, for more formal contacts)

**Text greetings (rotate across these):**
- "[Name]!" (for people he knows)
- "Hey [Name]," (casual)
- "[Name] -“" (slightly more formal text)
- "Hi [Name]," (for people he hasn't met)
- No greeting at all, just launch in (for close contacts)

### Sign-offs
**Emails:**
- "Best," + newline + "Taylor" (his default)
- "Thanks," + newline + "Taylor" (when he's asking for something specific)
- "Talk soon," + newline + "Taylor" (for warm contacts)
- Just "Taylor" (for very casual/familiar contacts)
- "- Taylor" (occasional)

**Texts:**
- No sign-off (default for texts - nobody signs texts)
- "- Taylor" (only when texting someone who doesn't have his number)

### Subject Line Patterns
Taylor's subject lines are short and specific. They should feel like something you'd text as a preview, not a newsletter headline.

**Good subject lines:**
- "Quick question"
- "Stanford + catching up"
- "Georgetown / AI consulting"
- "[Their company] + [your angle]"
- "Following up from [event/person]"
- "[Shared thing] / coffee?"
- "Intro from [mutual connection]"

**Bad subject lines (never use):**
- "Catching up / Stanford update" this is fine ONCE but the system was using it for every reconnect
- Anything formulaic: "[Group] / [Topic]" used identically across all cold emails
- Anything longer than 6 words
- Anything with "Opportunity" or "Request"

### Tone Calibration by Relationship Warmth

**Close (family, close friends, frequent contacts):**
- Very casual. Can be funny. Can reference inside jokes or shared history.
- Short messages. Sometimes just 1-2 sentences.
- "Dude, been too long. Calling you this week."

**Warm (former colleagues, school friends, professional contacts he's met):**
- Friendly but purposeful. References shared context naturally.
- 2-4 sentences typical.
- "Been a minute since we caught up. I'm making a move - heading to Stanford in the fall and building something on the AI side before I go. Would love to hear how [company] is going. Free for a quick call sometime soon?"

**Cool (met once, friend-of-friend, loose connection):**
- Professional but not stiff. Still sounds like a person, not an institution.
- 3-5 sentences typical.
- "We crossed paths briefly at [event] - I was with [mutual]. I've been thinking about [topic] and your work at [company] keeps coming up. Any chance you'd have 15 minutes for a call this month?"

**Cold (never met, no mutual, pure outbound):**
- Respectful of their time. Earns attention in the first sentence.
- Must establish relevance immediately â€” why you, why them, why now.
- 3-4 sentences max.
- "Hi [Name], I'm Taylor - I work in PE at Berkshire Partners and I'm heading to Stanford this fall. I've been digging into [their industry] and your approach at [company] stood out. Would you be open to a quick call? Happy to work around your schedule."

## WHAT TAYLOR NEVER SOUNDS LIKE

- A LinkedIn influencer ("Thrilled to share...")
- A recruiter ("Your background is impressive...")
- A chatbot ("I hope this message finds you well...")
- A sycophant ("I'm such a huge fan of your work...")
- A form letter ("I came across your profile and...")
- Overly grateful before they've done anything ("I'd be so grateful for just a moment of your time...")

## NATURAL VARIATION TECHNIQUES

To prevent pattern detection across a batch of messages:

1. **Vary the opening move.** Don't always start with context about yourself. Sometimes start with something about them. Sometimes start with the shared connection. Sometimes start with the ask.

2. **Vary sentence count.** Not every email is exactly 3 sentences + sign-off.

3. **Vary the ask framing.** Rotate between:
   - "You free for a call next week? Let me know if there's a day or time that works best."
   - "Any chance you'd have 20 minutes this month to chat? My schedul is flexible so please let me know what works for you."
   - "I'd like to hear your take. Are you free for 20-30 minutes in the coming days for a call? Let me know."
   - "If possible, please let me know what day / time might work for a call. Happy to work around your schedule."
   - "Let me know if you've got a window in the next couple weeks for a call. Looking forward to connecting."

4. **Vary how you introduce yourself.** Not always "I'm a [Group] alum heading to Stanford." Sometimes lead with your current work. Sometimes lead with the shared connection. Sometimes don't introduce yourself at all (if they know you).

5. **Vary the hook.** Not always "Saw your path from X to Y." Alternatives:
   - Reference something specific they did/wrote/built
   - Reference a mutual connection naturally
   - Reference a trend or event in their industry
   - Just state what you're working on and why they're relevant
   - Ask a genuine question that shows you did homework
