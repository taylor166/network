# Anti-Patterns: The Kill List

Every draft must be checked against this list before output. If ANY of these patterns appear, rewrite.

---

## STRUCTURAL ANTI-PATTERNS

### 1. The Identical Skeleton
**What it looks like:** Every cold email follows: [Shared group reference] -> [Their career path] â†’ [Your bio] -> ["vibe check" ask]
**Why it fails:** Recipients in the same network compare emails. Three people getting "Saw your path from X to Y. I'm a [Group] alum heading to Stanford..." in the same week = busted.
**Fix:** Use at least 3 different structural approaches per batch. Vary what comes first: the hook, the self-intro, the ask, or the shared context.

### 2. The Mad Libs Effect
**What it looks like:** The message is clearly a template with variables swapped. You can mentally highlight the {{variables}} because everything around them is identical.
**Why it fails:** Humans can feel this. Even if they can't articulate it, the message feels "off."
**Fix:** Rewrite the connective tissue between variables. Change the sentence structure, word choices, and transitions â€” not just the variables.

### 3. The Three-Paragraph Trap
**What it looks like:** Every email is exactly: [Opening paragraph] â†’ [Middle paragraph] â†’ [Ask paragraph + sign-off].
**Why it fails:** Real emails have varied structures. Sometimes they're 2 sentences. Sometimes they're 5 short paragraphs. Sometimes the ask is in the first line.
**Fix:** Vary paragraph count between 1 and 4. Vary sentence count per paragraph. Sometimes combine everything into one block.

## LANGUAGE ANTI-PATTERNS

### 4. The "Saw Your Path" Opener
**What it looks like:** "Saw your path from [X] to [Y]."
**Why it fails:** This was in the original template and went to every cold intro. It's now a signature of automation.
**Alternative openers:**
- "Your work at [company] caught my eye, specifically [detail]."
- "I've been thinking about [topic] and your name keeps coming up."
- "[Mutual connection] mentioned you when we were talking about [topic]."
- "[Specific thing they did/said/wrote] resonated with something I'm working on."
- Lead with a question: "How are you thinking about [trend] at [company]?"
- No opener at all â€” just state who you are and what you want.

### 5. The "Vibe Check" Crutch
**What it looks like:** "Would love to get your 'vibe check' on [topic]."
**Why it fails:** It's a distinctive phrase. Used once, it's charming. Used on 20 people in the same network, it's a tell.
**Rule:** Maximum ONE "vibe check" per 10 outreach messages. Alternatives:
- "I'd like to hear your take on..."
- "Curious how you're thinking about..."
- "Would value your perspective on..."
- "I'd like to hear how you see..."
- "Your read on [topic] would be useful."

### 6. Repeated CTAs
**What it looks like:** Every email ends with "Do you have 15 mins this month?" or every text ends with "looking forward to it!"
**Why it fails:** Same reason as above. Pattern = automation signal.
**Fix:** See the CTA rotation list in the Voice Guide. Use at least 4 different CTA phrasings per batch.

### 7. The Resume Drop
**What it looks like:** "I'm a [Group] alum heading to Stanford for my MBA this fall and I'm currently focused on building AI automation consulting."
**Why it fails:** This exact sentence appeared in nearly every cold intro screenshot. It's too polished, too complete, too identical.
**Fix:** Break it up. Vary which credentials you mention. Lead with different ones for different people:
- To a founder: lead with what you're building
- To a PE person: lead with Berkshire
- To a school alum: lead with the shared school
- To an operator: lead with the specific problem you're solving

### 8. Hollow Personalization
**What it looks like:** "I'd love to hear how things are at [Company]" when you clearly have no idea what's happening at their company.
**Why it fails:** It signals that you inserted their company name into a template. Real interest is specific.
**Fix:** Either reference something specific about their company/role, or don't reference it at all. "I'd love to catch up" is more honest than "I'd love to hear how things are at [Company I know nothing about]."

## TONE ANTI-PATTERNS

### 9. The Supplicant
**What it looks like:** "I'd be so grateful for just a few minutes of your time." "It would mean the world to me."
**Why it fails:** Taylor writes like a peer. He's asking for a conversation, not an audience with the Pope.
**Fix:** Make confident, simple asks. "You free for a call?" Not "Would you possibly be able to spare some time?"

### 10. The Robot
**What it looks like:** Perfect grammar, no contractions, every sentence the same length, zero personality.
**Why it fails:** Real people write with imperfect rhythm. They use fragments. They skip transitions sometimes.
**Fix:** Read it out loud. If it sounds like a press release, rewrite it until it sounds like someone talking.

### 11. The Overachiever
**What it looks like:** A cold email that tries to do five things: establish connection, give your bio, explain your business, reference their work, and make an ask â€” all in one message.
**Why it fails:** It's exhausting. The recipient's brain gives up halfway through.
**Fix:** Pick two things max. The rest can happen on the call.

## METADATA ANTI-PATTERNS

### 12. Broken Variables
**What it looks like:** "I've been following your work at your work." (from the Chris text screenshot)
**Rule:** If a variable isn't populated, the sentence containing it must be rewritten or dropped entirely. Never output a broken variable.

### 13. Wrong Channel Tone
**What it looks like:** A text that reads like a formal email, or an email that reads like a text.
**Rule:**
- Texts: shorter, more casual, no subject line, no formal greeting/sign-off (unless they don't know you)
- Emails: can be slightly longer, has subject line, has greeting and sign-off
- A text should never exceed 3 sentences unless there's a very good reason.
- An email should never exceed 6 sentences for initial outreach.

### 14. The Identical Subject Line
**What it looks like:** Every reconnect email has "Catching up / Stanford update." Every cold intro has "[Group] / [Topic]."
**Rule:** Vary subject lines. Even within the same category, no two subject lines in a batch should follow the same pattern.

## PRE-SEND CHECKLIST

Before finalizing any draft, verify ALL of the following:

- [ ] Does this pass the "5 side-by-side" test? (Would it look unique next to 4 other messages from this batch?)
- [ ] Is every variable populated? No broken references?
- [ ] Does the Once-Only Rule hold? (No repeated key nouns/phrases)
- [ ] Is the channel tone correct? (Text feels like a text, email feels like an email)
- [ ] Is the CTA different from the last 3 messages drafted?
- [ ] Is the opening move different from the last 3 messages drafted?
- [ ] If existing contact: is the personal update included?
- [ ] If Group is "Other" or blank: is there NO network reference?
- [ ] Would Taylor actually send this? Read it in his voice. If it feels off, rewrite.
