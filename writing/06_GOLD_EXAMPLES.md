## WARM RE-ENGAGEMENT EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Former McKinsey colleague, warm relationship, hasn't talked in ~1 year
**Channel:** Email
**Data:** Name: Sarah, Company: Stripe, Group: McK, last_contact: 14 months ago, Notes: "Worked on Pfizer engagement together. She moved to fintech."

```
SUBJECT: Stanford + checking in

Sarah -

Big news from my end: I'm leaving Berkshire and heading to Stanford in the fall. Building an AI automation practice in the meantime, which has been a different kind of adrenaline from PE.

How's Stripe? Last time we talked you were still getting your bearings in fintech. Curious how it's evolved.

Free for a call in the next couple weeks?

Best,
Taylor
```

**Why this works:** References their shared history naturally (not "as former McKinsey colleagues"). The note about "different kind of adrenaline" adds personality. The reference to her getting her bearings in fintech shows he actually remembers their last conversation.

---

### Example 2: Georgetown friend, close relationship, talked 3 months ago
**Channel:** Text
**Data:** Name: Marcus, Location: DC, Group: GU, last_contact: 3 months ago, relationship_warmth: close

```
Marcus - I'm winding things down in Boston and preparing to move to SF. Would love to hear how you're doing. Free this week for a call?
```

**Why this works:** Short. Direct. No filler. Doesn't recap his entire bio because Marcus already knows him. Feels like a real text between friends.

---

### Example 3: Berkshire colleague, warm relationship, 8 months since contact
**Channel:** Email
**Data:** Name: Priya, Company: KKR, Group: BP, last_contact: 8 months, Notes: "She left Berkshire for KKR about a year ago. We got along well."

```
SUBJECT: Quick catch-up

Priya -

I've been meaning to write since you made the move to KKR. How's it going over there?

Things have shifted on my end too. I'm heading to Stanford this fall and building something in AI consulting before I go. Or at least trying to build.

Would love to hear how you're settling in. You free for a call in the next few days?

Talk soon,
Taylor
```

**Why this works:** Leads with interest in her, not his own update. The "I've been meaning to write" is honest and human. The sign-off is "Talk soon" not "Best" - varies the pattern.

## COLD INTRO (SHARED NETWORK) EXAMPLES

### Example 4: Exeter alum, founder, cold
**Channel:** Email
**Data:** Name: David, Company: Meridian Labs (his startup), Group: PEA, previous_company: Bain, career_path_type: founder, industry: healthtech

```
SUBJECT: Exeter / healthtech question

David -

I'm a fellow PEA alum, and I'd love to connect. I'm curious to learn about Meridian Labs and hear your experience building the business.

I'm at Berkshire Partners right now, heading to Stanford in September. I'm building an AI automation practice on the side and healthtech delivery is one of the verticals I keep coming back to.

I'd like to hear how you're thinking about the build-vs-buy question for AI tooling. Would you have 15 minutes sometime this month?

Best,
Taylor
```

**Why this works:** Specific reference to their company (patient intake automation), not just "your work." The question he wants to discuss is specific and relevant to the founder â€” it's a real question, not a pretense.

---

### Example 5: McKinsey alum, operator at a larger company, cold
**Channel:** Text
**Data:** Name: Jen, Company: ServiceMaster, Group: McK, current_role: VP Ops, industry: field services

```
Hi Jen, Taylor Walshe here - fellow McKinsey alum, currently at Berkshire Partners. I've been digging into AI applications in field services and your work at ServiceMaster keeps surfacing. Any chance you'd be open to a brief call?
```

**Why this works:** For texts, brevity is critical. This establishes shared network, credibility, and specific relevance in three sentences. No "vibe check," no "I'm heading to Stanford."

---

### Example 6: Georgetown alum, investor, cold
**Channel:** Email
**Data:** Name: Alex, Company: Insight Partners, Group: GU, current_role: Principal, career_path_type: investor, industry: software

```
Alex -

I'm a fellow Georgetown alum reaching out as I'd love to chat. I'm at Berkshire Partners right now and starting at Stanford GSB this fall.

Between now and September I'm building an AI consulting practice targeting services businesses - think the operational layer that most software doesn't touch. You see a lot of this space from the Insight side and I'd value your pattern recognition.

Any chance you're free to chat in the coming days? Let me know if there's a day or time that works best.

Taylor
```

**Why this works:** Tailored to an investor's mindset. "Pattern recognition" is investor language. The description of his business is framed in a way that's interesting to someone who evaluates software companies.

---

## COLD INTRO (NO SHARED NETWORK) EXAMPLES

### Example 7: True cold outreach to a business owner
**Channel:** Email
**Data:** Name: Mike, Company: ProClean Solutions, Group: Other, industry: commercial cleaning, career_path_type: operator, recent_activity: expanded to 3 new markets

```
SUBJECT: ProClean's expansion + a question

Mike -

Saw that ProClean just expanded into three new markets. That's a serious operational lift for a services business.

I'm Taylor Walshe, currently in PE at Berkshire Partners. I'm building an AI automation practice specifically for services companies in the growth phase. The operational pain points you're probably hitting right now (scheduling, dispatch, customer intake) are exactly what I'm focused on.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call? Even if it's just to hear how you're handling the scaling challenge, I'd find it valuable.

Best,
Taylor
```

**Why this works:** Leads with something specific and timely (their expansion). Frames his interest as genuine curiosity, not a sales pitch. The "(scheduling, dispatch, customer intake)" shows domain knowledge.

---

### Example 8: Cold outreach to an industry expert
**Channel:** Email
**Data:** Name: Rachel, Company: McKinsey (current consultant), Group: Other, industry: field services, recent_activity: published a report on AI in services

```
SUBJECT: Your field services piece

Rachel -

Your recent report on AI adoption in field services hit on something I've been seeing from the operator side, particularly the gap between what vendors promise and what actually deploys.

I'm building an AI automation practice for services businesses (background in PE at Berkshire, heading to Stanford in the fall). I'd love to compare notes on where you're seeing real traction vs. vapor.

Any chance you'd have 15 minutes for a quick chat?

Best,
Taylor
```

**Why this works:** Opens with a reference to her actual work and adds a specific take on it (the promise-vs-reality gap). This shows he read it and has a point of view. Framing is peer-to-peer, not supplicant-to-expert.

---

## POST-CALL FOLLOW-UP EXAMPLES

### Example 9: After a great exploratory call
**Channel:** Email
**Data:** Name: Tom, Notes from call: "He's thinking about AI for his HVAC business. Worried about implementation complexity. Mentioned his dispatcher is his bottleneck."

```
SUBJECT: Following up â€” dispatch bottleneck

Tom -

Thanks for the conversation yesterday. Your point about the dispatcher being the single point of failure stuck with me - that's exactly the kind of problem where AI can make an immediate, measurable difference.

I'm going to put together a quick sketch of what an automated dispatch flow could look like for your setup. No commitment, just so you can see what's possible.

I'll have it to you by end of week.

Best,
Taylor
```

**Why this works:** References a specific pain point from the call. Takes initiative by promising a next deliverable. Clear timeline. No fluff.

---

## WARM INTRO REQUEST EXAMPLE

### Example 10: Asking a McKinsey friend to intro a founder
**Channel:** Email
**Data:** Connector: Lisa (McK friend). Target: James, founder of an HVAC software company.

```
SUBJECT: Quick intro ask

Lisa -

Would you be open to connecting me with James at [company]? I've been going deep on AI for field services businesses and what he's building is directly in that space.

If you're comfortable, feel free to forward this:

---
"James - wanted to connect you with Taylor Walshe. He's at Berkshire Partners, heading to Stanford this fall, and building an AI automation practice for services businesses. He's been specifically looking at HVAC operations and wanted to pick your brain. Taylor, over to you."
---

No pressure at all if the timing isn't right.

Best,
Taylor
```

**Why this works:** Clear ask, forwardable blurb, graceful exit. Lisa doesn't have to write anything â€” she can literally forward and be done.

---

## WHAT MAKES THESE EXAMPLES "GOLD"

Looking across all 10 examples, the common threads are:

1. **Every one feels like a different message.** You can't extract a master template from them.
2. **The personalizations are REAL.** Not variable-swapped. The sentence structures change to accommodate the personalization.
3. **The asks are varied.** Different framings, different time horizons, different levels of specificity.
4. **The tone matches the relationship.** Close contacts get casual, brief messages. Cold contacts get more structured but still human messages.
5. **No message tries to do everything.** Each one has a clear, singular purpose.
6. **They're SHORT.** The longest one is ~80 words in the body. Most are 40-60.
