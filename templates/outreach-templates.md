# Outreach Templates

## OUTREACH CHANNEL RULES

1. **If phone number exists → DEFAULT TO TEXT.**
2. **If no phone but email exists → USE EMAIL.**
3. **If both exist → TEXT FIRST.**
4. **If neither exists → attempt to source email; email is fallback.**

---

## VOICE GUIDELINES

- Write like a peer, never like a student.
- Avoid fluff, praise, or overly formal language.
- Keep messages efficient and natural.
- Establish relevance quickly.
- Make low-friction asks (quick call, brief chat).
- Keep subject lines of emails direct.
- **No emojis ever. No emdash ever.**
- Concise is better.

---

## TEMPLATE TYPE SELECTION

### Formal
- Use when: **Type = "2026 new"** AND **no last contact date** (assume you've never met)

### Informal/Casual
- Use when: **Type = "existing"** OR **has last contact date** (assume they know who you are)

---

## EMAIL TEMPLATES

### Email - Formal

**Subject:** Direct subject line (e.g., "Quick question" or "Hoping to connect")

**Body:**
```
Hi {{First Name}},

I came across your background through the {{Exeter / McKinsey / alumni / industry}} network and wanted to reach out given the shared connection. I'm currently {{one-line identity}}, and your experience {{specific observation: e.g., building X, transitioning into AI, starting Y}} stood out.

As I think through my next chapter, I'd value your perspective on {{topic: starting a business, developing AI capability, making the most of business school, operator paths, etc.}}.

Would you happen to have time to connect sometime in the coming weeks? I'm happy to work around your schedule.

Best,
Taylor
```

### Email - Casual

**Subject:** Direct subject line (e.g., "Catching up" or "Quick question")

**Body:**
```
Hi {{First Name}},

It's been a while since we last connected, and I wanted to reach out to see how you've been doing. Would love to hear what you've been up to and reconnect.

If you're open to it, it would be great to find time to catch up sometime in the coming weeks, and I'd especially enjoy getting your perspective on {{optional topic}}.

Hope all is well on your end and look forward to reconnecting.

Best,
Taylor
```

## TEXT TEMPLATES

### Text - Formal

```
Hi {{First Name}}, this is Taylor Walshe. We haven't met, but I came across your background through {{shared connection}} and wanted to reach out.

Happy to work around your schedule.
```

### Text - Casual

```
{{First Name}}! Hope {{location / role / recent life update}} is treating you well. It's been too long. Would love to catch up and hear what you've been up to. Any chance you're free for a quick call sometime in the next few days?
```

## PERSONALIZATION REQUIREMENTS

**Every outreach message MUST feel individually written.**

Use available profile data to customize the message while preserving the default structure.

### Primary Fields to Pull From

- **Company**
- **Current role**
- **Prior roles**
- **Shared groups** (McKinsey, Exeter, HBS, alumni networks, etc.)
- **Location / geography**
- **Notes from CRM**
- **Prior interactions**
- **Industry**
- **Career transitions**
- **Operator vs investor vs founder path**
- **Any unique or distinguishing detail**

### Personalization Priority Order

If multiple data points exist, prioritize relevance in this order:

1. **Shared identity** (McKinsey, school, mutual contact)
2. **Current role or company**
3. **Career move or transition**
4. **Industry overlap**
5. **Geography**
6. **Notes / prior conversations**
